export const description = "Pyrogens are substances that can cause fever when introduced into the body. In a laboratory setting, especially in fields like pharmaceuticals or biotechnology, it's crucial to use pyrogen-free equipment to prevent contamination. Pyrogen-free test tubes are designed and treated to ensure the absence of pyrogens, ensuring the accuracy and safety of experiments, particularly those involving biological samples or pharmaceuticals."
